As a computer science student born in Iran, I thought it would make more sense to write "Hello World" in Persian. [Dorood][dorood-wiktionary-page] stands for "Hello" and [Jahan][jahan-wiktionary-page] stands for "World".

I had a few blogs in the past (started when I was 12). After a short break, I thought I would start blogging again so that I can share my daily thoughts, ideas and learnings with others so that they can use them and I also have them in a written form so that I can take a look at them from time to time.
