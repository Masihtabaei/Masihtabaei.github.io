# Masih's Personal Page

I use [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) as a minimalist [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for running a personal page running on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Usage

Since I work with various technologies, remembering which command I have to use and where and how can get a little bit tricky. So, let's do it in the way that my grandma would do:

```bash
$ git clone <repository-name>
$ cd <repository-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle add <missing-package>
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
